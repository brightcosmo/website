            I am a dynamic software engineer + researcher pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Monash University.
            
            My time spent growing up as a third culture kid has provided me with a wide range of diverse perspectives. I also have 1+ years of experience from internships and teaching roles.
            
            My main interests lie in machine learning, cybersecurity, and blockchain. I love learning and teaching, and in the future I want to contribute research to emerging tech fields.
